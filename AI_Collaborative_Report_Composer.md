# Project Documentation: AI Report Composer

## 1. Introduction

**Project Name:** AI-Assisted Collaborative Report Composer  
**Objective:** Create a platform that combines a real-time collaborative text editor with AI capabilities, allowing users to write, research, and edit reports in a shared environment.

**Design:** Rich text editor on the left side, and the Co-Pilot on the right side.

## 2. High-Level Overview

1. **Collaborative Editor** - Real-time editing and collaboration using OT or CRDTs.  
2. **AI Copilot** - Integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate, refine, summarize, or edit text.  
3. **Middleware Service** - Manages orchestration between the editor, AI service, and data sources.  
4. **Data & External Integrations** - Company or external data sources for context retrieval.  

## 3. Key Features & Functionality

### 3.1 Rich Text Editor

- **Content Blocks:** Text, images, tables, callouts, etc.  
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit the same document concurrently.  
- **Version Control:** Maintain document history; allow reverting to previous versions if needed.  

### 3.2 AI Copilot

- **Text Generation & Editing:** The AI can generate entire sections, rewrite content, or summarize existing text.  
- **Contextual Prompts:** Users can highlight a section and request changes.  
- **Autonomous Web Search (Optional):** Fetch relevant data from the web or internal knowledge bases.  

### 3.3 Middleware Service

- **API Gateway:** Routes requests between the editor front-end and AI or data services.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensures only authorized users or processes can read/edit documents.  
- **Business Logic & Validation:** Interprets user or AI commands, then translates them into structured editor operations.  

### 3.4 Data Storage & Retrieval

- **Document Data:** Stored in NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) or relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL).  
- **External Data Sources:** Company database, web scraping, search APIs for enrichment.  

### 3.5 Export & Publishing

- **Format Conversion:** Export final documents into PDF format.  

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Editor & Collaboration Engine

- **Slate.js or ProseMirror** for rich text editing.  
- **Real-time collaboration** via WebSockets.  
- **Programmatic Editing API** to accept AI-driven text modifications.  

### 4.2 AI Integration

- Connect to an **LLM service** (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s GPT) for text generation.  
- Middleware to handle **prompt construction** and caching.  

### 4.3 Middleware Service

- Routes requests between the editor, AI service, and database.  
- Implements **authentication, data validation, and access control**.  

### 4.4 Data Store

- **NoSQL (MongoDB, Firestore)** for flexible real-time updates.  
- **PostgreSQL** for structured queries and transactional support.  

## 5. System Architecture Diagram

The architecture consists of a **front-end collaborative editor**, a **middleware service** that orchestrates AI interactions, and a **backend database**.  

## 6. User Flows & Interactions

1. **Document Creation** - Users create and edit reports in real-time.  
2. **AI Assistance** - AI suggests and modifies text upon user requests.  
3. **Exporting Documents** - Convert reports into different formats.  

## 7. Development Plan

- **Phase 1:** Editor & Collaboration.  
- **Phase 2:** AI Copilot Integration.  
- **Phase 3:** Data Source & Search Integration.  
- **Phase 4:** Export & Advanced Features.  
- **Phase 5:** Testing & Optimization.  

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- **Functional:** Real-time collaboration, AI editing, export functionality.  
- **Usability:** Intuitive UI, quick AI response times.  
- **Security:** OAuth authentication, encrypted data storage.  
- **Performance:** Fast document loading and AI suggestions.  

## 9. Team Roles & Responsibilities

- **Front-End Developer:** Implements editor and real-time collaboration.  
- **Back-End Developer:** Builds middleware, API, and data management.  
- **AI/ML Engineer:** Handles AI model integration and fine-tuning.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** Manages deployment, monitoring, and security.  

## 10. Conclusion

This document serves as a reference for development. The core focus is a **real-time collaborative editor** with **AI-driven enhancements**. Security, scalability, and user experience are key priorities.
